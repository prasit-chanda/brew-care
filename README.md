## 🤷 Overview

Meet `brew-care.zsh` — your **no-cost Mac savior** disguised as a humble shell script. 
It’s the all-in-one magic wand that keeps your **Homebrew ecosystem less embarrassing** and 
your Mac feeling like it just got back from a spa retreat. One command, and voilà — it’ll 
**sniff out outdated packages**, **fix broken links**, **massage your permissions**, and even 
**wrangle Xcode into behaving**. It’ll **upgrade everything it can get its hands on**, 
**relink mission-critical tools** like `brew`, `git`, `python3`, and `node` (because who needs 
things actually working, right?). Then, it **cleans up the digital junk drawer** and tells you 
how much disk space you just heroically reclaimed. Bonus? You get a **color-coded log** so pretty 
it might actually make you *want* to read your terminal output.
